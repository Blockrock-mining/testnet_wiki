Deployment of the test net software will be done using a program called «Docker».

Docker is compatible with Linux, MacOS and Windows, as well as with AWS-/Azure-cloud
services. It creates a virtual container that contains and runs the software provided by
Factom.

Step by step instructions is provided below for downloading and installing an ordinary
node on Linux, MacOS and Windows, as well as for the Linux version of the Authority
server.

The main support channel is in the Factom Community [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Aft2Bg) (community-testnet -> #wg-support).

If you are an experienced user you may skip these instructions, and head directly to
the [QuickStart instructions on the Factom community testnet GitHub page](https://github.com/FactomProject/communitytestnet/blob/master/Quickstart.md).
