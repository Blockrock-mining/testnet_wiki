services. It creates a virtual container that contains and runs the software provided by
Factom.

Step by step instructions is provided below for downloading and installing an ordinary
node on Linux, MacOS and Windows, as well as for the Linux version of the Authority
server.

The main support channel is in the Factom Community Testnet [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/q75MJGJ),
