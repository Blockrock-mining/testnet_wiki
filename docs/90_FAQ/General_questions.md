## Why does my node need to have a fixed IP address?

The requirement for a  fixed IP address is not a requirement for the Factom protocol itself. It is a requirement for the testnet.

If two machines with the same identity but different IP adresses would enter the Factom network, one would kill itself to avoid causing issues.
